            Write down what you think each of these would print, then use
            the active code window to check your results:

            #. ``9 * 5``
            #. ``2 / 5``
            #. ``5 % 2``
            #. ``9 % 5``
            #. ``6 % 6``
            #. ``2 % 7``
            #. ``3 / 0``
