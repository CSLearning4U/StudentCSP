Following the Ketchup Ooze
====================================

Let's compute how long it would take ketchup to ooze down a table.  Imagine that you tilted a four foot table, and poured ketchup at the top.  How long would it take to get to the bottom of the table?  We're going to ignore physics and the angle of the table, and just start from the average speed of ketchup as .028 miles per hour.

    Figure 2: Ketchup dripping speed

.. codelens:: Ketchup_Speed

   dripMPH = .028
   FPM = 5280.0
   dripFPH = dripMPH * FPM
   MPH = 60
   dripFPM = dripFPH / MPH
   print("Ketchup speed in feet per minute:")
   print(dripFPM)
   print("Time to move 4 feet in minutes:")
   print(4 / dripFPM)

   
The next type of problem is new.  It shows correct code in code blocks on the left side, but the order is mixed up.  You need to drag the blocks to the right side in the right order.  Please watch the video below for a demonstration.
