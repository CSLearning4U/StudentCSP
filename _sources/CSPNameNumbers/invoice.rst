Figuring out an Invoice
====================================

We can use variables to solve problems like those we might solve in a spreadsheet.  Imagine that you had a spreadsheet with an invoice for an office supply company.

    :figclass: align-center
    
    Figure 3: A spreadsheet with order information  

Here's a program to compute the total price for the invoice.  Be sure to click |audiobutton| to understand what's happening here.

.. activecode:: Invoice1
    :tour_1: "Line by line tour"; 1: inv-line1; 2: inv-line2; 3: inv-line3; 4: inv-line4; 5: inv-line5; 6: inv-line6; 7: inv-line7; 8: inv-line8; 

    quantity1 = 2
    unitPrice1 = 7.56
    total1 = quantity1 * unitPrice1
    quantity2 = 4
    unitPrice2 = 4.71
    total2 = quantity2 * unitPrice2
    invoiceTotal = total1 + total2
    print(invoiceTotal)

.. mchoice:: 3_8_1_Invoice1_Q1
		   :answer_a: 7
		   :answer_b: 6
		   :answer_c: 5
		   :answer_d: 2
		   :correct: a
		   :feedback_a: Yes, quantity1, unitPrice1, total1, quantity2, unitPrice2, total2, invoiceTotal.
		   :feedback_b: There are three variables per line, two lines, and one total.
		   :feedback_c: There are three variables per line, two lines, and one total.
		   :feedback_d: There are three variables per line, two lines, and one total.

		   How many variables are in this program?

We don't really have to create new variables ``quantity2`` and ``unitPrice2``.  We only use those to compute the total for the line, and then we could reuse those variable names.

.. codelens:: Invoice2

  quantity = 2
  unitPrice = 7.56
  total1 = quantity * unitPrice
  quantity = 4
  unitPrice = 4.71
  total2 = quantity * unitPrice
  invoiceTotal = total1 + total2
  print(invoiceTotal)

.. mchoice:: 3_8_2_Invoice2_Q1
		   :answer_a: 7
		   :answer_b: 6
		   :answer_c: 5
		   :answer_d: 2
		   :correct: c
		   :feedback_a: We have two fewer variables now.
		   :feedback_b: We have a total for each line (two), a quantity, a unitPrice, and an invoiceTotal.
		   :feedback_c: The variables are quantity, unitPrice, total1, total2, and invoiceTotal. 
		   :feedback_d: We have a total for each line (two), a quantity, a unitPrice, and an invoiceTotal.

		   How many variables are in this program?
		   
.. Note::
   It is best to use variable names that make sense like ``invoiceTotal`` and ``quantity`` instead of names that don't make any sense like ``thisVariableIsMyFriend`` and ``Fred``.  The name should help you remember what the variable is representing.  

Let's say that apples are $0.40 apiece, and pears are $0.65 apiece.  Modify the program below to calculate the total cost (it should print 3.55).

.. activecode:: Complete_Assignment

   numApples = 4
   numPears = 3
   
   costPerApple = 
   costPerPear = 
   
   totalCost =
   print(totalCost)

You are welcome to try out the following answers by copying and pasting them into the program above before answering this question:

.. mchoice:: 3_8_3_Make_An_Assignment_Q1
  :answer_a: totalCost = numApples + numPears
  :answer_b: totalCost = (costPerApple * numApples) + (costPerPear * numPears)
  :answer_c: totalCost = (costPerApple * numPears) + (costPerPear * numApples)
  :answer_d: totalCost = (0.4 * numApples) + (0.65 + numPears)
  :correct: b
  :feedback_a: That does not consider the cost of the apples or pears.
  :feedback_b: We need to multiply the cost per apple times the number of apples and add it to the cost per pear times the number of pears.
  :feedback_c: That gets the costs backwards
  :feedback_d: That would work, but giving names to numbers makes code easier to understand.

   Which line of code will compute the correct ``totalCost`` if put into the program above?

.. tabbed:: 3_8_4_WSt

        .. tab:: Question

           Write the code to calculate and print how many *paperclips* you can buy if each paperclip is $0.05 and you have $4.00 in your pocket.  It should print 80.
           
           .. activecode::  3_8_4_WSq
               :nocodelens:

        .. tab:: Answer
        
            Create variables to hold each value.  Calculate ``numPaperclips`` as ``budget / costPerClip``.  Be sure to print the result.
            
            .. activecode::  3_8_4_WSa
                :nocodelens:
                
                # DECLARE VARIABLES AND ASSIGN VALUES
                costPerClip = .05
                budget = 4.00
                # 2. CREATE FORMULA  
                numPaperclips = budget / costPerClip 
                # 3. PRINT RESULT 
                print(numPaperclips)
