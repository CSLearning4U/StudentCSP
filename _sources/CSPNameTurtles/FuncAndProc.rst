Procedures and Functions
================================

We have seen string **functions** like ``lower()`` which returns a new string with all lowercase characters.  **Functions** return a value.  The ``Screen()`` and ``Turtle()`` in the code below both create objects and return them, so they are functions.   You can also have **procedures** which do some action, but don't return anything.  The ``forward(75)`` and ``left(90)`` below are both procedures since they do an action, but don't return anything. 

.. note::
   Some Python books don't make a distinction between procedures and functions and will call both of these functions.  In this book we are using **function** only for named code that returns a value and **procedure** for named code that doesn't return a value.   
   

   
.. fillintheblank:: 5_2_1_LetterC_fill

   What letter (like A, B, C, D, etc) will the program below draw in block style when you click on the Run button?

   -    :^c$|^C$: Correct!
        :.*: Try to follow the directions as if you are the turtle     

.. activecode:: Turtle_C
    :nocodelens:
	
    from turtle import *    # use the turtle library
    space = Screen()        # create a turtle space
    alex = Turtle()         # create a turtle named alex
    alex.left(180)          # turn alex by 180 degrees
    alex.forward(75)        # move forward by 75 units 
    alex.left(90)           # turn left 90 degrees
    alex.forward(100)       # more forward by 100 units
    alex.left(90)           # turn left 90 degrees
    alex.forward(75)        # move forward by 75 units 
    
**Check Your Understanding**

.. mchoice:: 5_2_2_FuncOrProc
   :practice: T
   :answer_a: function
   :answer_b: procedure
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Does it return a value?
   :feedback_b: The right procedure will cause the turtle to turn right by the specified number of degrees and doesn't return any value so it is a procedure.

   Is right(90) a function or procedure?
    
.. note ::

   In these next problems we will draw a letter similar to how you might do it without lifting your pen or pencil.    See the numbers and arrows on the letters for the order that the lines are drawn.
    
**Mixed up programs**

.. parsonsprob:: 5_2_1_Turtle-T
   :numbered: left
   :adaptive:

   The following program uses a turtle to draw a capital T as shown below, but the lines are mixed up.  The program should do all necessary set-up: import the turtle module, get the space to draw on, and create the turtle.  After that the turtle should draw the lines in the numbered order as shown in the picture below.
   
   .. image:: ../../_static/TurtleT1.png
       :width: 150px
       :align: center

   Drag the needed blocks of statements from the left column to the right column and put them in the right order.  Then click on 'Check' to see if you are right. You will be told if any of the lines are in the wrong order or are the wrong blocks.
