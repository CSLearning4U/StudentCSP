.. mchoice:: e25_1_1
  :answer_a: A variable.
  :answer_b: A Function.
  :answer_c: Code.
  :answer_d: A String.
  :correct: d
  :feedback_a: Incorrect. A variable is name that a computer can associate with a value. For example, if <i>name</i> ='Alexa' then <i>name</i> is the variable and 'Alexa' is the value.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. Functions perform some action, like a procedure, and return a value. For example, x.lower() would return a new string in all lowercase.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. Code is what you are using to tell the computer how to function! You are learning how to code!
  :feedback_d: Correct. A string is characters typed between one, two, or three quotes.

  Which term does the following statement describe?

  *Any sequence of characters we can type between a pair of single, double, or triple quotes*

  :correct: d
  :feedback_a: Incorrect. This one is true! All Turing Machines have the ability to compute mathematical functions.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. This one is true! Turing Machines pass the Turing Test if they reflect human-like tendencies during the Turing Test.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. This one is true! A Turing Machine can read information that it is provided and write back results.
  :feedback_d: Correct. This answer is not true! All Turing Machines do have the ability to repeat steps.

  Which of the following is NOT true of a Turing Machine?

.. mchoice:: e25_1_3
  :answer_a: 'Fido'
  :answer_b: animal_3
  :answer_c: 'fish'
  :answer_d: Error
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. On line four, notice how <i>animal_1</i> is reassigned to 'Fido'. On the following line <i>animal_3</i> is reassigned to the value of <i>animal_1</i>, which is now 'Fido'.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. <i>animal_3</i> is the name of the variable.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. 'fish' is the new value of <i>animal_2</i> assigned on the last line.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. This code will run and there will not be an error.

  Use the following code for questions 3 and 4.

  What will print out when the code is run?

  ::


      animal_1 ← 'Garfield'
      animal_2 ← 'Fido'
      animal_3 ← 'Gary'
      animal_1 ← animal_2

  :answer_d: A variable
  :correct: d
  :feedback_a: Incorrect. <i>animal_1</i> is the name of the variable, but the type of <i>animal_1</i> is a variable.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. The value of <i>animal_1</i> is a string, however, <i>animal_1</i> is a variable assigned to that value.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. A function performs an action on variables and returns some result.
  :feedback_d: Correct. <i>animal_1</i> is a variable with a string as its value.

  Which of the following is *animal_1* an example of?

.. mchoice:: e25_1_5

  :answer_a: .25
  :answer_b: 0
  :answer_c: 1/4
  :answer_d: .2
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. In Python code, pseudo code as well, a decimal value will be returned from an integer calculation. Note that in older Python code, it would have printed 0. In other languages as well, the code will return the number just before the decimal.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. Because we are applying Python 3.0, the code will return a decimal.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. The code will calculate the value of a fraction.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. The value of 1/4 is .25, not .2 or .20.

  What will the above code print?

  :answer_c: 420
  :answer_d: 0
  :correct: b
  :feedback_a: Incorrect. Based on the order of operations, be sure to start with the inmost parentheses.
  :feedback_b: Correct. The expression will begin by adding <i>Right</i> + <i>Left</i> inside the parentheses then move to the outer parentheses to add Mid to the sum of <i>Right</i> + <i>Left</i>. The entire sum within the outer parentheses will then be multiplied by <i>Right</i>.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. Remember to follow the order of operations.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. The product is not 0. Remember to follow the order of operations.

  What is the value of *Product*?

  :answer_a: 2
  :answer_b: 4
  :answer_c: 0
  :answer_d: None
  :correct: c
  :feedback_a: Incorrect. 4 is divisible by 2, and 4/2 = 2, but MOD will produce the remainder value of 4/2.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. The remainder of 4/2 is not 4.
  :feedback_c: Correct. Because 4 is divisible by 2, there is no remainder.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. The answer is not None. MOD will return an integer.

  What will the following code print out?

  ::

    num ← 4 MOD 2
    DISPLAY (num)


.. mchoice:: e25_1_13
  :answer_a: 0.5
  :answer_b: 5.0
  :answer_c: 15.0
  :answer_d: 20
  :correct: b
  :feedback_a: Incorrect. 100 divided by 20 is 5.
  :feedback_b: Correct. Because they are float types, the value of 100.0/20.0 is equal to 5.0.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. 100 divided by 20 is not 15.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. 100 divided by 20 is not 20. The value of a float divided by a float is also a float.

  Use the following code for questions 13 and 14.

  What is the value of *gallons*?

  ::

    distance ← 100.0
    mpg ← 20.0
    gallons ← distance / mpg
    costPerGallon ← 3.00

.. mchoice:: e25_1_14
  :answer_a: 15.0
  :answer_b: 5.0
  :answer_c: 15.0
  :answer_d: 20
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. The value of <i>gallons</i> is 5.0, the value of <i>costPerGallon</i> is 3.00. Therefore, <i>costTrip</i> = 15.0.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. A float multiplied by a float is a float.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. The value of <i>costTrip</i> is the product of <i>gallons</i> multiplied by <i>costPerGallon</i>.

  :feedback_b: Correct. This function creates a square. Turtles start facing East.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. This function does not create a turtle shape.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. Write out the function. The turtle starts facing East, moves forward 100, turns right and does it again three more times.

  What shape will the turtle function return?

  ::

    def square(turtle):
      turtle.forward(100)
      turtle.right(90)
      turtle.forward(100)
      turtle.right(90)
      turtle.forward(100)
