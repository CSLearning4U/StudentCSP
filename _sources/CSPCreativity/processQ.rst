Progress and Process Questions
==============================

.. index:: Creativity 

When you submit your program, it will need to be accompanied by a set of responses to provided process and progress questions. Keeping track of your ideas and steps as you go will help you while creating your projects as well as simplify completion of your reflection. Below are some outline templates to help you get started. 

A. Your program must include elements of abstraction and algorithms. As you collaborate with your partner, fill out the following: 

+---------+--------------------+-------------+-----------+
|         | Purpose of Program | Abstraction | Algorithm |
+=========+====================+=============+===========+
|Code     |                    |             |           |
+---------+--------------------+-------------+-----------+
|Evidence |                    |             |           |
+---------+--------------------+-------------+-----------+


B. Create a project map. Outline the process you used to create your program and the challenges you faced.


+---------+-------------+---------------+---------------------+--------------------+
|         | Explanation | Contributions | What did you learn? | Problems/Solutions |
+=========+=============+===============+=====================+====================+
