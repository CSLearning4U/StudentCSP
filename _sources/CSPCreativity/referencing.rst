Referencing Code
=====================

.. index:: Creativity 

Just as you must cite your source when writing a research paper or creating a presentation, you must cite any code you reference while programming. 

1. **When should I cite my code?**
| According to ‘Academic Integrity at MIT <https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/writing-code>’_ guidelines for writing code, you should cite your code when: 
a. You directly copy any length of code from an external resource
b. You “paraphrase” or slightly modify code that you copy from an external resource 

2. **How do I cite my code?**
| ‘Academic Integrity at MIT <https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/writing-code>’_ also provides some tips on how to cite your code from another source: 
a.  Always include the URL and date of retrieval. You may consider including additional details to clarify the source. 
b. For modified code, include phrases such as “Based on:” or “Adapted from:” 
c. Ask your teacher for specifications to ensure you are following proper formatting and meeting all class requirements 
d. If you use Open Source Software click ‘here <https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/writing-code>’_for more details. 

| Below are useful templates for citing code provided by the ‘University of Arkansas <http://uark.libguides.com/CSCE/CitingCode>’_:

*Citing Code in Written Report* 
-------------------------------

**Format:** <author(s) names> (<date>) <title of program/source code> (<code version>) [<type>]. Web address or publisher.

**Example:** Smith, J (2011) GraphicsDrawer source code (Version 2.0) [Source code]. http://www.graphicsdrawer.com

*Citing Code in the Source Code* 
--------------------------------

**Format:** (place the information as a comment above the code you want to cite) The examples below use Python commenting format. You can also insert your citation as a comment in ‘Scratch <https://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Comment_(programming_feature)>’_and ‘App Inventor <http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/tips.html>’_.

“ “ “  Title: <title of program/source code>
