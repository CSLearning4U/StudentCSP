Compute with Turtles
=====================

A turtle here is not an animal.  
We are working with a virtual turtle, an idea that dates back to the 1960's.  The original robot turtle had a physical pen in it.  The student-programmers would steer the robot around using programs, and create drawings with the pen.

Today, we can play with virtual turtles in a fully-graphical and non-robotic way. Below is a Python program that first reads in a **library** that contains the code to let us work with turtles (``from turtle import *``). Then it creates a **Screen**, a space on the page for the turtle to move in and draw on (``space = Screen()``).  Next it creates a turtle named ``alex`` (``alex = Turtle()``), then has ``alex`` move around on the screen (``alex.forward(150)``) and when it moves it will draw. The part of any line that starts with a  ``#`` character is called a **comment**.  Python and the computer ignores everything from the ``#`` character to the end of the line.   **Comments** explain what we're doing in the programs and are intended to be read by people, not computers.

Try clicking the |runbutton| button below to see what the following program does.

.. activecode:: Turtle_1
    :tour_1: "Line-by-line Tour"; 1: first-turtle-line-1; 2: first-turtle-line-2; 3: first-turtle-line-3; 4: first-turtle-line-4; 5: first-turtle-line-5; 6: first-turtle-line-6;
    :nocodelens:
	
    from turtle import *	# use the turtle library
    space = Screen()		# create a turtle space
    alex = Turtle()   		# create a turtle named alex
    alex.forward(150)		# move forward by 150 units
    alex.left(90)   		# turn by 90 degrees
    alex.forward(75)		# move forward by 75 units 
   
   
..	index::
	single: dot notation
	
.. Note::
   Notice that we tell ``alex`` what to do in the code above using **dot notation**: ``alex.forward(150)``, 	``alex.left(90)``, and ``alex.forward(75)``.  That is how you communicate with a turtle.  You use the name of the turtle followed by a ``.`` and then what you want it to do.  

.. mchoice:: 1_5_1_Turtle_Q1
   :answer_a: North
   :answer_b: West
   :answer_c: South
   :answer_d: East
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Check which way alex moved first
   :feedback_b: Check which way alex moved first
   :feedback_c: Check which way alex moved first
   :feedback_d: Turtles start off facing east by default
   
   Which direction will alex move when the code below executes? 
   
   :: 
   
      from turtle import *       
      space = Screen()    		  
      alex = Turtle()   		
      alex.forward(100)  

Just by going forward, backward, left, and right, we can have a turtle draw a shape.

   What shape will the program below draw when you click on the Run button? 
   
   -    :^square$|^Square$|^SQUARE$: Correct!
        :.*: Did you actually run the program?
