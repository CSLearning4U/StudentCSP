..	index::
    single: loop body
    single: for loop
	single: pixel
	single: nested loop

- **For Loop** - A ``for`` loop is a programming statement that tells the computer to repeat a statement or a set of statements (**which are the body of the loop**). It will repeat a specific number of times.
- **Loop Body** - The statement or statements that are repeated in a loop.  In Python indention is used to show what statements are part of the body of a loop.
- **Nested Loop** - A nested loop has one loop inside the body of another loop.  
- **Pixel** - A pixel is one small part (element) of a picture.  Pixels are stored in a grid and have both a x (horizontal) and y (vertical) value.  A pixel has a color which can be defined by an amount of red, green, and blue with values from 0 to 255.
