============================

Chapter 18 included the following concepts from computing.

..	index::
    single: close
    single: comment
    single: find
    single: open
    single: split


- **Comment** - A comment in Python starts with a ``#`` and the computer will ignore everything from that character to the end of that line.  Comments are used to explain your code to people.

Summary of Python Keywords and Functions
------------------------------------------- 
- **Close** - The ``close`` procedure closes a file after you are done processing it.  
- **Find** - The ``find`` function is used like this ``strName.find(test)``.  It returns the index of ``test`` in ``strName`` if it is found and -1 if it is not found.
- **Open** - The ``open`` procedure opens the passed file for either reading or writing.  
- **Split** - The ``split`` function returns a list of strings separated by a specified character.  For example, if ``message = "Nora, Jones, 15"`` then ``message.split(",")`` would return ``['Nora', 'Jones', '15']``.
