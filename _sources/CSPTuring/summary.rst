Chapter 2 - Concept Summary
============================

Chapter 2 included the following concepts from computing.

..	index::
	single: ASCII
	single: binary
	single: bit
	single: byte
	single: character
	single: computer
	single: Java
	single: program
	single: programming language
	single: programming tool
	single: Python
	single: Turing machine

- **ACSII**-ASCII is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. It is abbreviated from the American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
- **Binary**-Binary is a number system comprised of only two numbers: 0 and 1.
- **Bit**-A bit is short for binary digit and is the smallest piece of information that a computer can store. Bits are either 0s or 1s.
- **Byte**-A byte is a sequence of data that is eight bits long.
- **Character**-A character is anything that can be entered into a computer via a keyboard: letters, numbers, spaces, punctuation marks, or symbols.
- **Computer** - A computer is a device that can perform actions on input (which is also called data).
- **Java** - Java is a **programming language**.  It is used in the Advanced Placement Computer Science A course.
- **Program** - A program is a set of instructions that a computer can understand to accomplish some goal.  This is sometimes called **code**.
- **Programming Language** - A programming language is used to tell a computer what to do.  Some examples are **Python** and **Java**.
- **Programming Tool** - A programming tool is used to do programming.  One example is Scratch which is at http://scratch.mit.edu.
- **Python** - Python is a **programming language**.  It is the language you will use in this ebook.
- **Turing Machine** - A Turing machine is a theoretical computer that can read instructions from a tape and write results to the tape.
