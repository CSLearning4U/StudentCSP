.. timed:: ch1a2ex

    .. mchoice:: e1a2_1
       :answer_a: dog
       :answer_b: fish
       :answer_c: cat
       :answer_d: bird
       :correct: a
       :feedback_a: The value of var3 is first set to "bird" but then changed to be the value of var1.  The value of var1 is first set to "cat" but later changed to the value of var2 which was set to "dog".
       :feedback_b: Only var2 has the value of fish.  When you assign the value of a variable to the value of another variable the value is copied to the new variable.  No relationship is created between the two variables.
       :feedback_c: The value of var3 is first set to "bird" but then changed to be the value of var1.  However, the value of var1 also is changed after it is originally set.
       :feedback_d: While var3 is originally set to "bird" the value is changed later.

       What is the value of var3 after the following code executes?

       ::

          var1 = "cat"
          var2 = "dog"
          var3 = "bird"
          var1 = var2
          var3 = var1

       :feedback_b: When var1 is assigned to have the same value as var2 the value from var2 is copied and not changed.
       :feedback_c: That is the original value of var3.  What is the value of var2?
       :feedback_d: When one variable (var1) is set to the value of another (var2) it copies the value from the other (var2).  It does't change the value in the other (var2).

         from turtle import *        # use the turtle library
         space = Screen()            # create a turtle screen (space)
         zari = Turtle()             # create a turtle named zari
         zari.setheading(90)
         zari.forward(100)           # tell zari to move forward by 100 units
         zari.right(90)              # turn by 90 degrees
         zari.forward(50)           # tell zari to move forward by 50 units
         zari.right(90)              # turn by 90 degrees
         zari.forward(100)           # tell zari to move forward by 100 units
         zari.right(90)              # turn by 90 degrees
         zari.forward(50)           # tell zari to move forward by 50 units
         zari.right(90)              # turn by 90 degrees
