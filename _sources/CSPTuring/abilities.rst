Computer Abilities
==================================

In this book, we are going to talk about what a computer can do in terms of the programming language **Python**.  We are not going to cover *all* of Python.  We are going to describe the four abilities of a computer, the four abilities that cover *everything* that a computer can do.

- Computers can remember names for values.  Computers can name *anything*.
- Computers can repeat steps.
- Computers can make decisions.
- Computers can take data apart.
