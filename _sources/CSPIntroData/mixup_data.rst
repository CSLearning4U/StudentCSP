Mixed Up Code Practice
------------------------------

Try to solve each of the following. Click the *Check Me* button to check each solution.  You will be told if your solution is too short, has a block in the wrong order, or you are using the wrong block.  Some of the problems have one or more extra blocks that aren't needed in the correct solution.  Try to solve these on your phone or other mobile device!

   The following program segment should swap the first and last values of the list "numbers" using indexing. But, the blocks have been mixed up and include an extra block that isn't needed in the solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.
