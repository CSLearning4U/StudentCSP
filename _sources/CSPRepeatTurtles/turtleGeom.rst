|bigteachernote| Teacher Note: Turtle Geometry
===============================================
The turtle is actually useful for exploring a wide variety of ideas in geometry.  The book `Turtle Geometry <http://www.amazon.com/Turtle-Geometry-Mathematics-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/0262510375>`_ does a wonderful job of showing how turtles can be used to explore a wide variety of geometric, mathematical, and scientific ideas (e.g., using turtles to model insect behavior).  The example **pattern** below is drawn from that book.

Total Turtle Trip Theorem
===========================

That last piece of code is actually a **pattern** for a wide variety of geometric shapes.  Here's a triangle.  It may not be obvious why we turn 120 in this program, but it will be soon.

.. activecode:: Turtle_Triangle
    :tour_1: "Lines of code"; 1: tR3-line1; 2: tR3-line2; 3: tR3-line3; 4: tR3-line4; 5: tR3-line5; 6: tR3-line6; 7: tR3-line7;
    :nocodelens:
  
    from turtle import *   	# use the turtle library
    space = Screen()    	# create a turtle space
    avery = Turtle()   		# create a turtle named avery
    avery.setheading(90)   	# point due north
    for sides in range(3):	# repeat the indented lines 3 times
      	avery.forward(100)    	# move forward by 100 units
      	avery.right(120)         	# turn by 120 degrees

And here's a pentagon.

.. activecode:: Turtle_Pentagon
    :tour_1: "Lines of code"; 1: tR3-line1; 2: tR3-line2; 3: tR4-line3; 4: tR4-line4; 5: tR4-line5; 6: tR4-line6; 7: tR4-line7;
    :nocodelens:
	
    from turtle import *   	# use the turtle library
    space = Screen()    	# create a turtle space
    will = Turtle()   		# create a turtle named will
    will.setheading(90)    	# point due north
    for sides in range(5):	# repeat the indented lines 5 times
      	will.forward(100)      	# move forward by 100 units
      	will.right(72)          	# turn by 72 degrees

The **Total Turtle Trip Theorem** states that the turtle will draw a closed figure with *n* sides when the sum of the angles turned is a multiple of 360.  In the triangle example ``3 * 120 = 360`` and in the pentagon example ``5 * 72 = 360``.

Change the ``??`` in line 7 below to the amount to turn each time to draw a 12 sided polygon, which is called a dodecagon.  If you get it right the turtle will draw a 12 sided closed polygon.

.. activecode:: Turtle_Dodecagon
    :tour_1: "Lines of code"; 1: tR3-line1; 2: tR3-line2; 3: tR5-line3; 4: tR5-line4; 5: tR5-line5; 6: tR5-line6; 7: tR5-line7;
    :nocodelens:
	
    from turtle import * 	# use the turtle library
    space = Screen()   		# create a turtle space
    mia = Turtle()   		# create a turtle named maria
    mia.setheading(90)     	# point due north
    for sides in range(12):	# repeat the indented lines 12 times
      	mia.forward(40)       	# move forward by 40 units
      	mia.right(??)          	# change ?? to the amount to turn

.. mchoice:: 10_2_1_Turtle_Dodecagon_Q1
   :answer_a: 15
   :answer_b: 30
   :answer_c: 12
   :answer_d: 90
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This one will not close
   :feedback_b: Exactly! 12 * 30 = 360
   :feedback_c: No, 12 * 12 is 144, which is not a multiple of 360
   :feedback_d: This one will generate a square, three times. 12 * 90 = 1080 = 360 * 3

   How much does ``mia`` need turn in the program above to create a closed dodecagon (12-sided figure)?  Only one of these works.
   
.. parsonsprob:: 10_2_2_Triangle
   :numbered: left
   :adaptive:

   The following program uses a turtle to draw a triangle as shown to the left, <img src="../_static/TurtleTriangle.png" width="150" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5"/> but the lines are mixed up.  The program should do all necessary set-up and create the turtle.  After that, iterate (loop) 3 times, and each time through the loop the turtle should go forward 100 pixels, and then turn left 120 degrees.<br /><br /><p>Drag the needed blocks of statements from the left column to the right column and put them in the right order with the correct indention.  There may be additional blocks that are not needed in a correct solution.  Click on <i>Check Me</i> to see if you are right. You will be told if any of the lines are in the wrong order or are the wrong blocks.</p>
