The Turtle Stamp Procedure
============================

You can change the shape of the turtle using the ``shape`` procedure.  In the program below we set it to look more like a turtle.  

A turtle can also **stamp** a copy of itself on the screen (turtle drawing area), and this will remain after the turtle has moved somewhere else.  Do this with the ``stamp`` procedure.  Stamping works even when the pen is up.  You can ask the turtle to pick up the pen using the ``up`` procedure as shown below.  When the pen is up the turtle will not draw a line when it moves.

Here is an example that shows off these new features.

.. activecode:: stampex
   :tour_1: "Line-by-line Tour"; 1: stamp1-line1; 2: stamp1-line2; 3: stamp1-line3; 4: stamp1-line4; 5: stamp1-line5; 7: stamp1-line7; 8: stamp1-line8; 9: stamp1-line9; 10: stamp1-line10; 11: stamp1-line11; 12: stamp1-line12; 
   :nocodelens:

   from turtle import *
   space = Screen()
   tess = Turtle()
   tess.color("blue")
   tess.shape("turtle")

   print(range(5, 60, 2))
   tess.penup()                  # ask tess to pick up her pen 
   for size in range(5, 60, 2):  # start with size = 5 and grow by 2
       tess.stamp()                # leave an impression on the canvas
       tess.forward(size)          # move tess along
       tess.right(24)              # and turn her

The list of integers shown under the picture above is created by printing the ``range(5,60,2)`` result.  This shows you the distances used to move the turtle forward each time through the ``for`` loop.  

All except one of the shapes you see on the screen here are copies of the turtle shape created by ``stamp``.  But the program still only has *one* turtle instance --- can you figure out which one is the real tess?  (Hint: if you're
not sure, write a new line of code after the ``for`` loop to change tess' color, or to put her pen down and draw a line, or to change her shape, etc.)

**Mixed up program**

.. parsonsprob:: 10_4_1_turtle-stamp
   :numbered: left
   :adaptive:

   The following program uses the stamp method to create a line of turtle shapes as shown to the left, <img src="../_static/Turtle3Stamp.png" width="150" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" /> but the lines are mixed up.  The program should do all necessary set-up, create the turtle, set the shape to "turtle", and pick up the pen.  Then the turtle should repeat the following three times: go forward 50 pixels and leave a copy of the turtle at the current position.  <br /><br /><p>Drag the needed blocks of statements from the left column to the right column and put them in the right order with the correct indention.  Click on <i>Check Me</i> to see if you are right. You will be told if any of the lines are in the wrong order or are the wrong blocks.</p>
