More Turtle Stamp Practice
============================

This section provides more practice using the **stamp** procedure.

**Mixed up program**

.. parsonsprob:: 10_5_1_turtle-x
   :numbered: left
   :adaptive:

   The following program uses the stamp method to create an X of turtle shapes as shown to the left, <img src="../_static/TurtleStampX.png" width="150" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" /> but the lines are mixed up.  The program should do all necessary set-up, create the turtle, set the shape to "turtle", and pick up the pen. Stamp the blue turtles before you stamp the green ones.   <br /><br /><p>Drag the needed blocks of statements from the left column to the right column and put them in the right order with the correct indention.  Click on <i>Check Me</i> to see if you are right. You will be told if any of the lines are in the wrong order or are the wrong blocks.</p>

.. parsonsprob:: 10_5_2_turtle-squares
   :numbered: left
   :adaptive:

   The following program uses the stamp method to create two squares of turtle shapes as shown to the left, <img src="../_static/TurtleStampDoubleSquare.png" width="150" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" /> but the lines are mixed up.  The program should do all necessary set-up, create the turtle, set the shape to "turtle", and pick up the pen.  Draw the blue square before you draw the green one.<br /><br /><p>Drag the needed blocks of statements from the left column to the right column and put them in the right order with the correct indention.  Click on <i>Check Me</i> to see if you are right. You will be told if any of the lines are in the wrong order or are the wrong blocks.</p>

Use the area below to try to draw a pattern using a ``for`` loop and the ``stamp`` procedure.
