Making Patterns within Patterns
===============================

We now know the pattern for creating any polygon.  We can wrap that pattern in another loop to create `spirograph <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph>`_ like patterns.  The example below uses pentagons, but you can use other polygons instead.

..	index::
	pair: for loops; nested
	single: setExecutionLimit

.. note::
   The outer ``for`` loop in the code below on line 8 executes 20 times and the inner ``for`` loop on line 13 executes 5 times *for each* of the outer loop values, 5 times when the outer loop value is 0, 5 times when the outer loop value is 1, 5 times when the outer loop value is 2, and so on.  The inner loop is executed a total of 20 * 5 = 100 times.  The turtle can take a long time to finish drawing this pattern.  Normally code in the browser is limited to only running in 10 seconds or less.  But, we can use the ``sys`` library (short for system) ``setExecutionLimit(milliseconds)`` procedure which will let the code run for up to the specified number of milliseconds.  One second is 1,000 milliseconds, so 50,0000 milliseconds is 50 seconds.  

.. activecode:: Turtle_Spirograph1
    :tour_1: "Lines of code"; 1-2: tr3-1-line1-2; 3: tr3-1-line3; 4: tr3-1-line4; 5: tr3-1-line5; 6: tr3-1-line6; 8: tr3-1-line8; 9: tr3-1-line9; 10: tr3-1-line10; 13: tr3-1-line13; 14: tr3-1-line14; 15: tr3-1-line15;
    :nocodelens:
	
    from turtle import *     # use the turtle library
    from sys import *        # use the system library
    setExecutionLimit(50000) # let this take up to 50 seconds
    space = Screen()         # create a turtle space
    zoe = Turtle()           # create a turtle named zoe
    zoe.setheading(90)       # point due north
    
    for repeats in range(20):   # draw the pattern 20 times
      	zoe.forward(10)         	# Offset the shapes a bit
      	zoe.right(18)             	# And turn each one a bit
      
      	# This part makes a pentagon
      	for sides in range(5):    # repeat 5 times
      	    zoe.forward(50)         # move forward by 50 unit
      	    zoe.right(72)           # turn by 72 degrees

By setting the pen color differently, we can distinguish the part that draws the shape, from the part that draws *between* the shapes.
