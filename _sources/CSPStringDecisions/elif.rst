Using elif for more options
================================
We have used ``if`` and ``else`` to handle two possible options, but what could you do for if you want more than two options?  What if you want to test if a value is negative, 0, or positive?  One way to do this using multiple ``if`` statements is shown below.

.. activecode:: sd_three_options
    :tour_1: "Structural Tour"; 1: sd5-line1; 2-3: sd5-line2-3; 4-5: sd5-line4-5; 6-7: sd5-line6-7;

    x = 8
    if x < 0:
        print("x is negative")
    if x == 0:
        print("x is 0")
    if x > 0:
        print("x is positive")

Run this several times and change the value of x each time.  Try it with a positive number, a negative number, and 0 to check that it works correctly.  Modify the code to
take a number as input from the user instead.

..  index::
    single: elif

Another way to choose between three options is to use ``if`` followed by ``elif`` and finally ``else`` as shown below.

.. activecode:: sd_three_options_elif
    :tour_1: "Structural Tour"; 1: sd6-line1; 2-3: sd6-line2-3; 4-5: sd6-line4-5; 6-7: sd6-line6-7;

    x = 8
    if x < 0:
        print("x is negative")
    elif x == 0:
        print("x is 0")
    else:
        print("x is positive")

Which way is better?  It turns out that beginners have an easier time understanding 3 ``if`` statements.  Experts prefer using ``if``, ``elif``, and ``else`` since it takes less time to execute and makes it less likely that you will miss a value.

**Mixed up programs**

.. parsonsprob:: 13_4_1_string_elif
   :numbered: left
   :adaptive:

   The following program should report which team won or if there was a tie.  But the code has been mixed up.  Drag it into the right order with the right indention.
   -----
   team1 = 20
   team2 = 20
   =====
   if (team1 > team2):
       print("team1 won")
   =====
   elif (team2 > team1):
   =====
       print("team2 won")
   =====
   else:
   =====
       print("team1 and team2 tied")

You can use as many ``elif`` statements as you need.  You can only have one ``else`` statement.  What if you have scaled some data from 0 to 1 and want to know what quartile a value is in?

.. activecode:: sd_four_options
    :tour_1: "Structural Tour"; 1: sd7-line1; 2-3: sd7-line2-3; 4-5: sd7-line4-5; 6-7: sd7-line6-7; 8-9: sd7-line8-9;

    x = .25
    if x <= .25:
        print("x is in the first quartile - x <= .25")
    elif x <= .5:
        print("x is in the second quartile - .25 < x <= .5")
    elif x <= .75:
        print("x is in the third quartile - .5 < x <= .75")
    else:
        print("x is in the fourth quartile - .75 < x <= 1")

.. mchoice:: 13_4_2_elif1
   :answer_a: x is in the first quartile - x <= .25
   :answer_b: x is in the second quartile - .25 < x <= .5
   :answer_c: x is in the third quartile - .5 < x <= .75
   :answer_d: x is in the fourth quartile - .75 < x <= 1
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This will only print if x is less then or equal to .25.
   :feedback_b: This will print if the other if's were not true, and if x is less than or equal to .5.  By moving lines 6-7 before lines 4-5 this will never print.
   :feedback_c: This will print if the other if's are not true and if x is less than or equal to .75.  So, moving lines 6-7 before lines 4-5 messes up what this code is intended to do and incorrectly prints that .5 is in the third quartile.
   :feedback_d: This will only print if all of the other if's were false.

   What would be printed if you moved lines 6-7 before lines 4-5 and set x equal to .5?

Here's the fortune teller code from before but now it is written using ``elif`` and ``else`` instead of just ``if``.

.. activecode:: fortune_elif
    :tour_1: "Structural Tour"; 1: elif1-line1; 2-3: elif1-line2-3; 4-5: elif1-line4-5; 6-7: elif1-line6-7; 8-9: elif1-line8-9; 10-11: elif1-line10-11;
    :nocodelens:

    num = input ("Type a number from 1 to 5. Then click OK or press enter")
    if num == "1":
        print("You will get a treat.")
    elif num == "2":
        print("You will lose something.")
    elif num == "3":
        print("You will meet a new friend.")
    elif num == "4":
        print("You will catch a cold.")
    else:
        print("You will ace a test.")

.. mchoice:: 13_4_3_fortune-elif-1
   :answer_a: 1
   :answer_b: 2
   :answer_c: 5
   :answer_d: 6
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: It will have to test if <code>num</code> is equal to 1 and because that is false it will test if <code>num</code> is equal to 2.
   :feedback_b: With the <code>elif</code> it won't execute the other <code>elif</code>'s if one of them is true.
   :feedback_c: With <code>elif</code> it will test each until one of the conditions is true and then skip the rest.
   :feedback_d: There are only 5 logical expression here so it can't be more than 5.
