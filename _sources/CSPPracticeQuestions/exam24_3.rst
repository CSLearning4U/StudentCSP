Click the "Start" button when you are ready to begin the exam.  Click the "Pause" button to pause the exam (you will not be able to see the questions when the exam is paused).  It will show how much time you have used, but you have unlimited time.  Click on the "Finish Exam" button at the end when you are done.  The number correct, number wrong, and number skipped will be displayed at the bottom of the page.  Feedback for each answer will also be shown as well as your answer.

You will not be able to change your answers after you hit the "Finish Exam" button.

      :feedback_c: Correct. The subdomain is always on the left of the domain name.
      :feedback_d: Incorrect. Subdomains are always on the left side of the domain and use a "." instead of a "/".

      :answer_a: Algorithm A always calculates the correct average, but Algorithm B may not.
      :answer_b: Algorithm B always calculates the correct average, but Algorithm A may not.
      :answer_c: Both Algorithm A and Algorithm B always calculate the correct average.
      :answer_d: Neither Algorithm A nor Algorithm B always calculate the correct average.
      :correct: a
      :feedback_a: Correct. Algorithm A correctly calculates the average, while Algorithm B does not.
      :feedback_b: Incorrect. Algorithm B would calculate the average if the groups of four took an average of their scores.
      :feedback_c: Incorrect. Algorithm B would calculate the average if the groups of four took an average of their scores.
      :feedback_d: Incorrect. Algorithm A correctly calculates the average.

      There are 16 students standing in a classroom. Each student is given back his or her graded homework. Students decide to find out the class’s average score on the homework. Two different algorithms are given for finding the average score.
       
      ::
       
       
        Algorithm A
        Step 1: All students stand.
        Step 2: A randomly selected student writes his or her score on the whiteboard
        and is seated.
        Step 3: A randomly selected standing student adds his or her score to the value 
        on the whiteboard, records the new value on the whiteboard, and is seated. 
        The previous value on the whiteboard is erased.
        Step 4: Repeat step 3 until no students remain standing.
        Step 5: The value on the whiteboard is divided by 16.

        Algorithm B
        Step 1: All students stand.
        Step 2: Students form groups of 4.
        Step 3: In each group, the students with the lowest and highest scores return 
        to their seats.
        Step 4: Repeat steps 1 and 2 until only two students remain standing.
        Step 5: Add the remaining two students’ numbers and divide the sum by two.

   .. mchoice:: e24_3_3
      :answer_a: How does the temperature fluctuate from day to night?
      :answer_b: Is there a correlation between air temperature and precipitation?
      :answer_c: What is the average annual precipitation?
      :answer_d: What is the average daily temperature? 
      :correct: c
      :feedback_a: Incorrect. The meteorologists have temperature data from days and nights so they can compare the differences between them.
      :feedback_b: Incorrect. The meteorologists have temperature and precipitation data, so they can compare them and determine if there is a correlation.
      :feedback_c: Correct. The meteorologists only have data from one year, so they cannot calculate the average annual precipitation.
      :feedback_d: Incorrect. The meteorologists have temperature data for an entire year, so they can find the average of daily temperatures across that time range.

      Meteorologists record atmospheric data to predict future weather conditions. Suppose that a meteorological lab in Atlanta takes hourly measurements of air temperature and precipitation in the city for a total period of 12 months. Note that the lab also records the exact time and date for each measurement. 

      Which of the following questions about the city’s weather could NOT be accurately answered using only the data collected by the lab?

      :answer_d: Is there a correlation between Atlanta’s temperature and Chicago’s temperature?
      :correct: b
      :feedback_a: Incorrect. The meteorologists do not have wind speed data.
      :feedback_b: Correct. The meteorologists have precipitation data for a year, so they can calculate this.
      :feedback_c: Incorrect. The meteorologists do not have air pressure data.
      :feedback_d: Incorrect. The meteorologists do not have data for Chicago's temperature.

      :answer_b: 7
      :answer_c: 5
      :answer_d: 3
      :correct: d
      :feedback_a: Incorrect. This would be true for a hexadecimal value of 38.
      :feedback_b: Incorrect. This would be true for a hexadecimal value of 37.
      :feedback_c: Incorrect. This would be true for a hexadecimal value of 35.
      :feedback_d: Correct. The ASCII value would be '51'.

      ASCII is a character-encoding scheme that uses numeric values in decimal (base 10)  to represent alphanumeric and special characters. For example, the uppercase letter ‘A’ is represented by the decimal value ‘65’. Digits from ‘0’ - ‘9’ also have a corresponding ASCII value. The digit ‘0’ has an ASCII value of ‘48’, ‘1’ has an ASCII value of ‘49’ and so on.We can represent the ASCII value of digits as hexadecimal  numbers (base 16) as well. Which digit has a hexadecimal value of ‘33’?

      :answer_a: The long data type can store 2^48 times as many distinct values as the short data type
      :answer_b: The long data type can store 2^64 times as many distinct values as the short data type
      :answer_c: The long data type can store 2^16 times as many distinct values as the short data type
      :answer_d: The short data type can store 4 times as many distinct values as the long data type
      :correct: a
      :feedback_a: Correct. It can store 2^(64 - 16) as many distinct values.
      :feedback_b: Incorrect. That is how many total values the long data stores.
      :feedback_c: Incorrect. That is how many total values the short data stores.
      :feedback_d: Incorrect. While long data is 4 times as long as the short, the question asks for the difference in distinct values the data type can hold.

      Imagine there is a programming language which uses two different data types to store integers - a 16-bit short data type and a 64-bit long data type. Then which of the following statements is true about the two data types?

      :feedback_a: Incorrect. Option III will not give them the maximum pay, and won't give them any bonus.
      :feedback_b: Incorrect. Both of these options are incorrect.
      :feedback_c: Correct. Both of these options correctly calculate each employee's pay.
      :feedback_d: Incorrect. Options II and III both incorrectly calculate the employee's pay.

      At a company, n number of employees are given the same bonus of $5,000 on top of their salary.  However, each person can only get a maximum of $100,000 a year, so if adding the bonus causes the employee’s total pay to surpass $100,000, the employee will receive the maximum pay of $100,000.  Each employee’s original annual salary is stored in a list entitled employeeList, indexed from 1 to n.
