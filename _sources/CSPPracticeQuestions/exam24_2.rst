       :answer_a: Animal, Favorite Food 
       :answer_b: Animal Size, Quantity, Favorite Food
       :answer_c: Animal, Quantity
       :answer_d: Favorite Food
       :correct: a
       :feedback_a: Correct. The Name of the animal and an animal's Favorite Food do not influence total money made from selling the animals.
       :feedback_b: Incorrect. Quantity is important in calculating total money made because each animal costs a price and the total amount for an animal is (price x quantity). 
       :feedback_c: Incorrect. Quantity is important in calculating total money made because each animal costs a price and the total amount for an animal is (price x quantity). 
       :feedback_d: Incorrect. Favorite Food is not important for calculating price, but an Animal's name is not important for calculating total money.

       :correct: d
       :feedback_a: Incorrect. The quantity of animal isn't considered if trying to determine what food to prepare.
       :feedback_b: Incorrect. Price and quantity of an animal isnt considered when determining which food to prepare. 
       :feedback_c: Incorrect. Favorite food is important for the manager to know, but quantity of animal is not important in determining what food to prepare.

       If the store manager wants to prepare food for small size animals only, which of the following categories should he/she use?


    .. mchoice:: e24_2_5
       :answer_a: The run-time is directly proportional to the input size.
       :answer_b: The run-time is inversely proportional to the input size.
       :answer_c: The run-time of the program does not change with respect to the input size.
       :answer_d: The run-time first increases and then decreases as the input size is increased.
       :correct: a
       :feedback_a: Correct. This is true because every additional input requires the same amount of additional time.
       :feedback_b: Incorrect. This is incorrect because the number of steps doesn't decrease with more inputs for this algorithm.
       :feedback_c: Incorrect. The number of steps an algorithm goes through does influence the the time an algorithm takes to run for this algorithm. 
       :feedback_d: Incorrect. As the number of inputs increases, the number of steps in this algorithm will always be increasing in this case. 

       If the number of steps that an algorithm takes is equal to a linear function of the input size, then which of the following statements is true regarding the runtime of the algorithm? 

       
    .. mchoice:: e24_2_6
       :answer_a: The output of the circuit is always true
       :answer_b: The output of the circuit is the same as the value of input A
       :answer_c: The output of the circuit is the same as the value of input B
       :answer_d: The output of the circuit is always false
       :correct: b
       :feedback_a: Incorrect. If A is false, then the output is false in this circuit.
       :feedback_b: Correct. If either A or B is false, then the second input to Or is false, thus the final output is dependent on the value of A.
       :feedback_c: Incorrect. In all cases, the output depends on the value of A instead of the value of B
       :feedback_d: Incorrect. If A is true, the circuit will always output true for a given B.

       Which of the following statements is true about the output of this circuit?

       Consider the following code snippet that takes a positive integer ‘n’ as input and answer the question that follows

           ELSE
               DISPLAY(“EVEN”)

       Which of the following statements are true?
       ::
       
        I.   “ODD” is printed n/2 times if n is even
        II.  “ODD” is printed (n + 1)/2 times if n is odd
        III. “EVEN” is printed (n - 1)/2 times if n is odd

       :answer_a: Heuristic algorithm
       :answer_b: Brute-Force algorithm
       :answer_c: Recursive algorithm
       :answer_d: Dynamic Programming
       :correct: a
       :feedback_a: Correct. A Heuristic algorithm atempts to find an approximation of a solution without finding the exact solution.
       :feedback_b: Incorrect. Brute-Forcing is trying to find a solution using trial and error. 
       :feedback_c: Incorrect. A Recursive algorithm is an algorithm that calls itself until a condition is met, at which point it stops. 
       :feedback_d: Incorrect. Dynamic Programming is breaking a problem into smaller sub-problems in order to find the correct answer. 

        The Traveling Salesman Problem is a problem in theoretical computer science in which one tries to find the shortest route that passes through every point in a set, once and only once. The optimal solution to the problem for an arbitrary set of of points cannot be found in a reasonable amount of time, that is, it cannot be found in polynomial time. However, we can find an approximation to the optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time. It would be best to find the approximate solution using a

       :answer_c: I. and IV. only
       :answer_d: III. and IV. only
       :correct: d
       :feedback_a: Incorrect. temp == 0 will cause the temperature to increment to 1 when temp == 0 and temp greater than 0 will cause the temperature to only increment above temp == 0.
       :feedback_b: Incorrect. temp == 0 will cause the temperature to increment to 1 when temp == 0 
       :feedback_c: Incorrect. temp == 0 will cause the temperature to increment to 1 when temp == 0 
       :feedback_d: Correct. These two conditionals will not allow temp to go above 0

       In a freezer, the temperature can be increased, but should not go above 0° C.  It can, however, be exactly equal to 0° C. The unfinished code for increasing the temperature in a freezer is shown below.  The variable temp represents the current temperature in degrees Celsius.

    .. mchoice:: e24_2_10
       :answer_a: A new electronic device that requires knowledge of the internal details, because it is important to know all the details of the device before using it. 
       :answer_b: A topographical map of the United States, because not all features of the geography are present, but the essence of the geography is present
       :answer_c: A painting by Picasso, because the painting does not contain as many details as a photograph, but it still communicates the emotion of the event being painted
       :answer_d: Pressing on the brake pedal of your car, because you don’t have to know how brakes work in order to stop the car
       :correct: a
       :feedback_a: Correct. Abstraction doesn't require knowledge of internal details to understand the overall function of a device. 
       :feedback_b: Incorrect. This is a good example because not every part of the real landscape is represented on a map, only key features.
       :feedback_c: Incorrect. This is a good example because knowledge of details is not required to understand the overall concept. 
       :feedback_d: Incorrect. This is a good example because knowledge of how a car brake functions is not required to press a car brake.

       What is NOT a good example of abstraction?
