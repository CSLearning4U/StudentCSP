       :answer_a: value
       :answer_b: Second
       :answer_c: parameter
       :answer_d: First
       :correct: b
       :feedback_a: When you print a variable it will print the value of the variable.
       :feedback_b: When you call myFunction("Second") the value of parameter is set to "Second".  This code prints the value of the variable called "value" which is set to the value of parameter.  
       :feedback_c: When value = parameter is executed the value of parameter is copied into the space called value.  
       :feedback_d: While value was first set to "First" it was changed to a copy of the value of parameter.

       What value is printed when the following code is executed?

       ::

          name = "John Smith"
          def myFunction(parameter): 
              value = "First" 
              value = parameter 
              print (value) 

          myFunction("Second")
           
    .. mchoice:: e5a6_2
       :answer_a: <img src="../_static/squarea.png" alt="A square with the first line in black and the next 3 in red" width="300">
       :answer_b: <img src="../_static/squareb.png" alt="A square with all lines in red" width="300">
       :answer_c: <img src="../_static/squarec.png" alt="A square with the first two lines in black and the last two in red" width="300">
       :answer_d: <img src="../_static/squared.png" alt="A square with the first three lines in black and the last one in red" width="300">
       :correct: c
       :feedback_a: This would be true if the alice.pencolor("red") was after the first forward.
       :feedback_b: This would be true if the alice.pencolor("red") was before the first forward.
       :feedback_c: Since the alice.pencolor("red") is after the second forward the first two lines will be black and the last two will be red.
       :feedback_d: This would be true if the alice.pencolor("red") was after the third forward.

       Which picture would the following code produce?
       
       ::
       
          from turtle import *
          screen = Screen()
          alice = Turtle()
          alice.forward(50)
          alice.left(90)
          alice.forward(50)
          alice.left(90)
          alice.pencolor("red")
          alice.forward(50)
          alice.left(90)
          alice.forward(50)
          
    .. mchoice:: e5a6_3
       :answer_a: bob.move(50)
       :answer_b: bob.left(50)
       :answer_c: bob.forward(50)
       :answer_d: bob.right(50)
       :correct: c
       :feedback_a: Turtles don't understand move.
       :feedback_b: The left procedure turns the turtle left by the specified amount.
       :feedback_c: Turtles have a forward procedure which moves the turtle in the direction it is facing by the specified amount.
       :feedback_d: The right procedure turns the turtle right by the specified amount.

       Given the following lines of code, which will move the turtle bob 50 units forward?
       
       ::
       
          from turtle import * 
          space = Screen() 
          bob = Turtle()
          
    .. mchoice:: e5a6_4
       :answer_a: definition
       :answer_b: procedure
       :answer_c: turtle
       :answer_d: function
       :correct: d
       :feedback_a: You use the def keyword to define a procedure or function.  
       :feedback_b: A procedure doesn't return anything.
       :feedback_c: Turtles have procedures and functions.  
       :feedback_d: A function returns a result.

       A named sequence of statements that returns a result is known as which of the following?
           
    .. mchoice:: e5a6_5
       :answer_a: <img src="../_static/checka.png" alt="Shorter line to south and then longer line to east" width="300">
       :answer_b: <img src="../_static/checkb.png" alt="Longer line to south and then shorter line to east" width="300">
       :answer_c: <img src="../_static/checkc.png" alt="Longer line to north and then shorter line to east" width="300">
       :answer_d: <img src="../_static/checkd.png" alt="Shorter line to north and then longer line to east" width="300">
       :correct: d
       :feedback_a: This would be true if it was right first and then left.
       :feedback_b: This would be true if it was right first and then left and if the first forward was 150 and the last was 75.
       :feedback_c: This would be true if it was the shorter line to the north and the longer to the east.
       :feedback_d: This will draw the shorter line to the north and then the longer one to the east.

       Which picture would the following code produce?
   
       ::
       
          from turtle import * 
          space = Screen() 
          sue = Turtle()
          sue.left(90)
          sue.forward(75)
          sue.right(90)
          sue.forward(150)
          
           
    .. mchoice:: e5a6_6
       :answer_a: Two squares connected with a straight line
       :answer_b: Two triangles connected with a straight line
       :answer_c: Two rectangles connected with a straight line
       :answer_d: Nothing
       :correct: b
       :feedback_a: This would be true if the right turns were 90 and there were four forwards
       :feedback_b: This procedure will draw a triangle and it is called twice so it draws two triangles
       :feedback_c: This would be true if the right turns were 90 and there were four forwards with two different forward amounts
       :feedback_d: This would be true if we only defined the procedure and didn't execute it.

       What will the following code draw?
       
       ::
       
          def shape(turtle): 
              turtle.left(60)
              turtle.forward(100)
              turtle.right(120)
              turtle.forward(100)
              turtle.right(120)
              turtle.forward(100)
              turtle.right(120)
              
          from turtle import *
          space = Screen()
          luis = Turtle()
          shape(luis)
          luis.forward(200)
          shape(luis)
