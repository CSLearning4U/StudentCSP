*Learning Objectives:*

- Create a variable that can store text (a string) 
- Add (append or concatenate) strings together to create new strings
- Introduce the ``input`` function and the concept of a function. 
- Convert a number into a string to concatenate it to another string
- Use dot-notation to invoke functions on string objects
- Introduce some string functions like ``lower``, ``capitalize``, ``len``, and ``find``.
- Show that strings are immutable (don't change)

Concatenating (Appending) Strings 
-----------------------------------

Computers can use names to represent *anything*.  In the last chapter we saw that we can name numbers (declare a variable and set its value to a number) and then do calculations using the names for the numbers.  We can also name **strings** and do calculations with their names, too.  A **string** is a sequence of characters enclosed in a pair of single, double, or triple quotes like ``'Hi'``, ``"How are you?"``, or ``'''Why can't you do that?'''``.  What does it mean to do a calculation on a string?  Well, Python uses the ``+`` symbol to **concatenate** strings as shown below.  **Concatenate** means to create a new string with all the characters in the first string followed by all of the characters in the second string.  This is also called **appending** strings together.  

.. activecode:: String_Assign
   :tour_1: "Line-by-line Tour"; 1: sa1-line1; 2: sa1-line2; 3: sa1-line3; 4: sa1-line4; 
   
   first = "Jorge"
   last = "Garcia"
   fullName = first + " " + last
   print(fullName)
   
Now try running this slightly different example.  
   
.. activecode:: String_Assign2
   
   first = 'Jorge'
   last = "Garcia"
   fullName = first + last
   print(fullName)
   
.. note::
   Blank spaces are not automatically added when you append two strings.  If you want a blank space in between two strings then put it there explicitly using a string with just a space in it ``" "`` as shown in ActiveCode1.
   
Try to run the example below.  It should give you errors.  Can you fix the errors?  
   
.. activecode:: String_Assign3
   
   first = 'Jorge"
   last = 'Garcia"
   fullName = first " " last
   print(fullName)
   
.. note::
   A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in a pair of single, double, or triple quotes.  If you start a string with a single quote you must end it with a single quote.  If you start a string with a double quote you must end it with a double quote.  You must use the ``+`` operator to append strings together.
   
We can use the ``input`` **function** in Python to get your first and last name and then print your full name.  A **function** can take input and returns some value.  
   
.. activecode:: String_Input
   
   first = input("What is your first name?")
   last = input("What is your last name?")
   fullName = first + " " + last
   print("Your full name is " + fullName)
   
Concatenating Strings and Numbers
-----------------------------------

You can print both strings and numbers, and you can concatenate strings using ``+``, but if you try to concatenate a string and a number you will get an error. The string ``"5"`` is stored very differently than the number ``5`` in computer memory, so to concatenate the number ``5`` and a string we need to convert the number into a string first.  The ``str(num)`` function will convert a number into a string.  

.. activecode:: String_Convert
   :tour_1: "Line-by-line Tour"; 1: sa3-line1; 2: sa3-line2; 3: sa3-line3; 4: sa3-line4; 
   
   Fred = 5
   print("Fred")
   print(Fred)
   print("Fred" + " is " + str(Fred))
   
.. note::
   Notice how printing the string ``"Fred"`` prints something different than printing the value of the variable ``Fred``. Printing the string ``"Fred"`` prints the exact characters in that string. Remember that strings are enclosed in pairs of double or single quotes and when they are printed it will print the exact characters in the string. When you print a variable it will print the *value* of that variable.  
   
We can update our driving example to print out the cost of the trip with just one ``print`` statement.

.. activecode:: Trip_Calculator2
   :tour_1: "Line by line tour"; 1: trp-line1; 2: trp-line2; 3: trp-line3; 4: trp-line4; 5: trp-line5; 6: trp2-line6;

   distance = 924.7
   mpg = 35.5
   gallons = distance / mpg
   costPerGallon = 3.65
   costTrip = gallons * costPerGallon
   print("Cost to get from Chicago to Dallas: $" + str(costTrip))

.. mchoice:: 4_1_1_stringVsValue
   :practice: T
   :answer_a: The address is street
   :answer_b: The address is 125 Main Street
   :answer_c: It won't execute
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Since street is in double quotes it will print the string street rather than the value of the variable street.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it was print("The address is " + street)
   :feedback_c: While this isn't printing what we probably want it to, it will print something.


   Given the following code segment, what will be printed?
   
   ::

     street = "125 Main Street"
     print("The address is " + "street")
     
.. mchoice:: 4_1_2_noSpace
   :practice: T
   :answer_a: 125 Main Street, Atlanta, GA
   :answer_b: 125 Main Street,Atlanta, GA
   :answer_c: 125 Main Street Atlanta, GA
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be true if it was street + ", ".
   :feedback_b: There isn't a space after the comma and one isn't added automatically.
   :feedback_c: What about the comma?

   What will be printed when the following executes?
   
   :: 

     street = "125 Main Street"
     cityState = "Atlanta, GA"
     print(street + "," + cityState)
