       :answer_c: John Smith + likes to play outside.
       :answer_d: John Smith likes to play outside.
       :correct: d
       :feedback_a: This would be true if it was print ("name" + "words"), but name and words are not in quotes so the value of each will be printed.
       :feedback_b: This would be true if it was print ("name + words").
       :feedback_c: The would be true if it was print (name + " +" + words).
       :feedback_d: When you use a variable name in a print statement the value of the variable is printed.  The + sign is used to join strings together.  

       What is printed after the following code is run?
       
       ::

          name = "John Smith"
          words = " likes to play outside." 
          print (name + words)
           
    .. mchoice:: e3a4_2
       :practice: T
       :answer_a: Tests to see if the values on each side of the expression are equal
       :answer_b: Assigns the name on the left to the value on the right
       :answer_c: Copies the value from the right to the left
       :answer_d: Creates two new objects, one named cat and one named meow
       :correct: b
       :feedback_a: This would be true if it was cat == "meow"
       :feedback_b: A name on the left and a value on the right creates a variable with that name and that value.
       :feedback_c: This would be true if it was a variable name on the right instead of a string.
       :feedback_d: This creates a variable and sets its value.  It doesn't create an object.

       In the following code, what does the "=" do?
       
       ::
       
          cat = "meow"
           
    .. mchoice:: e3a4_3
       :practice: T
       :answer_a: I only
       :answer_b: II only 
       :answer_c: III only
       :answer_d: all of them
       :correct: b
       :feedback_a: There are no quotes around the string so this gives an error.  
       :feedback_b: When you use '+' it appends the strings together so this will print the correct string
       :feedback_c: Answer III will not work since there is no variable called Morrissey.
       :feedback_d: Answer II will work, but not answer I or answer III.  Number I has no quotes around the string. In III there is no variable called Morrissey.

       Which of the following line(s) of code will print out "My name is Morrissey"?
       
       ::
       
          I.   print (My name is Morrissey)
          II.  var1 = "My name is " 
               var2 = "Morrissey" 
               var3 = var1 + var2 
               print (var3)
          III. M = "M" 
               orrissey = "orrissey" 
               print ("My name is " + Morrissey)

       :answer_a: 0
       :answer_b: 2
       :answer_c: 5
       :answer_d: 1
       :correct: d
       :feedback_a: This would be true if it was 4 % 2 since 2 goes in evenly into 4.
       :feedback_b: This would be true if you were trying to divide 5 by a number that was larger than 5.  
       :feedback_c: This would be true if it was 5 % 3.  
       :feedback_d: 2 goes into 5 2 times with a remainder of 1.

       What is printed after the following executes?
   
       ::
       
          result = 5 % 2
          print(result)

       :answer_a: 3
       :answer_b: 10
       :answer_c: 18
       :answer_d: 0 
       :correct: b
       :feedback_a: While var2 starts out set to 3 it changes when it is set to a copy of the value in var1.
       :feedback_b: While var2 starts out set to 3 it changes to a copy of the value in var1 which is 10.
       :feedback_c: This is the value of var1 after the code executes.
       :feedback_d: You would have to set var2 to 0 at some point for this to be true.

       What is the value of var2 after the following code executes?
       
       ::
       
          var2 = 3
          var1 = 10
          var2 = var1
          var3 = var2
          var1 = 18

       :feedback_b: This would be true if the question asked for the value of better.
       :feedback_c: This would be true if the question asked for the value of betterStill 
       :feedback_d: This would be true if the question asked for the value of more.

       What is the value of sentence after the following code executes?
   
       ::
       
          sentence = "THIS IS A TEST"
          better = sentence.lower()
          betterStill = better.capitalize() + "."
          more = sentence + ", really!"
