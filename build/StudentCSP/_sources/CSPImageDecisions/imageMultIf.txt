Multiple If's with Images
===========================

..	index::
	single: posterize

We can use multiple if's to reduce the number of colors in an image.  Let's say that if we have a little bit of each of red, green, and blue, we want to make each of them zero.  If we have more, we set them to a mid-range value like 120.  This is called **posterizing** because it reduces all the colors in a picture to a small number of colors -- like the ones you might use if you were making a poster.

                b = 120
            
            # CREATE THE COLOR
            newPixel = Pixel(r,g,b)
            
            # CHANGE THE IMAGE
            img.setPixel(x, y, newPixel)
     
    # SHOW THE CHANGED IMAGE       
    win = ImageWin(img.getWidth(),img.getHeight())
    img.draw(win)
    
Rewrite the code for posterizing an image using if and else rather than multiple if's.  Test that it still works correctly. 

.. mchoice:: 15_4_1_posterize1
   :answer_a: 8
   :answer_b: 3
   :answer_c: 120
   :answer_d: 16,777,216 (= 256 * 256 * 256) 
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Two possible values of each of red, green, and blue (3 colors) is 2 raised to 3rd power combinations which is 8.
   :feedback_b: Two values of each of red, green, and blue is more than 3.
   :feedback_c: Far fewer
   :feedback_d: That's the total number of colors possible.  But this code reduces that.
   
   How many different colors will be in our image when we are done?
