Chapter 3 - Summary
============================

Chapter 3 included the following concepts from computing.

..	index::
	single: arithmetic expression
	single: assignment
	single: assignment dyslexia
	single: camel-case
	single: integer division
	single: mixed-case
	single: modulo
	single: remainder
	single: tracing
	single: variables

- **Arithmetic Expression** - An arithmetic expression contains a mathematical operator like ``-`` for subtraction or ``*`` for multiplication.  
- **Assignment** -  Assignment means setting a variableâ€™s value.  For example, ``x = 5`` assigns the value of 5 to a variable called ``x``.  
- **Assignment Dyslexia** - Assignment Dyslexia is putting the variable name on the right and the value on the left as in ``5 = x``.  This is not a legal statement.  
- **Camel-Case** - Camel-case is when the first letter of each additional word is uppercased when you create variable names that have several words in them like ``firstName``.  
- **Integer Division** - Integer division is when you divide one integer by another. In some languages this will only give you an integer result, but in Python 3 it returns a decimal value.  
- **Mixed-Case** - Mixed-case means using upper and lower case letters in a variable name like ``"HI There"``.  One way to do this is to use camel-case.  
- **Modulo** - The modulo, or remainder operator, ``%``, returns the remainder after you divide one value by another.  For example the remainder of ``3 % 2`` is 1 since 2 goes into 3 one time with a remainder of 1.  
- **Tracing** - Tracing a program means keeping track of the variables in the program and how their values change as the statements are executed.  We used a Code Lens tool to do this in this chapter.  
- **Variable** -  A variable is a name associated with computer memory that can hold a value and that value can change or vary. One example of a variable is the score in a game.
