Summary of Expression Types
============================

+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Expression | Arithmetic meaning                                                                              |
+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1 + 2      | Addition, the result is 3                                                                       |
+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3 * 4      | Multiplication, the result is 12                                                                |
+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1 / 3      | Integer division, the result is 0 in older Python environments, but 0.333333333333 in Python 3  |
+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2.0 / 4.0  | Division, the result is 0.5, since you are using decimal numbers in the calculation             |
+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2 % 3      | Modulo (remainder), the result is 2                                                             |
+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -1         | Negation, the result is -1                                                                      |

.. mchoice:: 3_3_1_intDiv_Q1
   :answer_a: 0
   :answer_b: 1
   :answer_c: 0.75
   :answer_d: 0.25
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: If the two values are both integers (whole numbers) you will normally get an integer (whole number) result in older Python environments.  But, this book is using Python 3 so you get a decimal result.
   :feedback_b: This would be correct if the result was rounded up before the values after the decimal point were thrown away, but it does not do this.   
   :feedback_c: While this isn't the what older Pyton development environments would return, in this book we are using Python 3 so it returns a decimal result.
   :feedback_d: This would be correct if it was <code>1 / 4</code>, <code>1.0 / 4</code>, or <code>1 / 4.0</code>

   What is the result of ``3 / 4``?
    
.. mchoice:: 3_3_2_mod_Q1
   :answer_a: 0
   :answer_b: 1
   :answer_c: 2
   :answer_d: 3
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This would be correct if it was <code>18 % 2</code>, but what is the remainder of 18 divided by 5? 
   :feedback_b: This would be correct if it was <code>18 % 17</code>, since 17 goes into 18 one time and the remainder is 18 - 17 = 1.  
   :feedback_c: What is the highest multiple of 5 that is less than or equal to 18? The remainder is 18 - that number.
   :feedback_d: The reminder is 3 since 5 goes into 18 three times (15) and 18 - 15 = 3.  

   What is the result of ``18 % 5``?
   
.. mchoice:: 3_3_3_mod_Q2
   :answer_a: 0
   :answer_b: 1
   :answer_c: 2
   :answer_d: 6
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be correct if it was <code>6 % 2</code>.  
   :feedback_b: This would be correct if it was some odd number divided by 2, but it is not.
   :feedback_c: 6 goes into 2 zero times with 2 left over.  
   :feedback_d: If you have a smaller number divided by a larger number the remainder is always the smaller number. 

   What is the result of ``2 % 6``?
