Vary the Change Amount in Range
================================

.. index:: 
	pair: range; change amount

There is a version of ``range`` that takes an **change amount**, so that you can go up by more than one each time, or even down by a negative number.  Try it out!

.. activecode:: addEvensQ1
  :tour_1: "Line by Line Tour"; 2: lst7-line1; 3: lst7-line2; 6: lst7-line3; 9: lst7-line4; 12: lst7-line5; 

  # initialize the variables
  numbers = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
  evens = []
  
  # loop though every other index
  for index in range(0,len(numbers),2):
  
      # add the lists
      evens = evens + [numbers[index]]
      
  # print the result
  print(evens)

.. mchoice:: 16_6_1_addEvensQ2
   :multiple_answers:
   :correct: a,b
   :answer_a: Start with numbers=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
   :answer_b: Change the range to range(1,len(numbers),2)
   :answer_c: Change the range to range(0,len(numbers),1)
   :answer_d: Change the range to range(0,len(numbers),3)
   :feedback_a: Yes, that would work, but there's an easier way
   :feedback_b: Yes, just by starting at 1, then skipping 2 each time, we'd collect the odds
   :feedback_c: No, that would collect all the numbers in evens
   :feedback_d: No, that would result in 0,3,6,9 in evens

   Which of these changes to the program would give you just the odd values in a list? (Again: Try it!)  Select all that work.
