For Each Item Loop
===================

.. index:: 
	pair: loop; for each
	
Because it is very common to use a ``for`` loop to touch each of the elements of a collection, we can do it without even using a ``range`` and ``index``.  We can use a ``for`` loop that repeats the body of the loop one time for each value in the collection.  This is sometimes called a **for each loop** since it repeats the body of the loop one time for each element in the collection.  It works for both strings and lists as shown below.

.. activecode:: For_Each
  :tour_1: "Line by Line Tour"; 2: lst3-line1; 5: lst3-line2; 8: lst3-line3; 11: lst3-line4; 14: lst3-line5; 17: lst3-line6;
  
  # initialize the list
  myList = [0,1,2,3,"end"]
  
  # loop through the items in the list
  for item in myList:
  
      # print the current item
      print(item)
      
  # initialize the string
  myString = "MLK"
  
  # loop through the characters in the string
  for character in myString:
  
      # print the current character
      print(character)

This isn't actually a different ``for`` loop.  The function ``range`` actually creates a list of numbers, and the index just steps through each of those items one at a time.

.. activecode:: For_Each_Range
  :tour_1: "Line by Line Tour"; 2: lst4-line1; 3: lst4-line2; 6: lst4-line3; 7: lst4-line4;
  
  # initialize the variables
  myString = "MLK"
  myList = range(0,len(myString))
  
  # loop through the indices in myList and print each character
  for index in myList:
      print(myString[index])

.. mchoice:: 16_8_1_foreachRangeQ
   :answer_a: We would get an error for doing math in a range function.
   :answer_b: We would get an error because len(myString)/2 is 1.5 which can't be used in a range.
   :answer_c: We would get "M L K" printed with one character per line.
   :answer_d: We would get "M L K " printed with one character per line plus an extra space at the end.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: You are allowed to do math in a range function.
   :feedback_b: Dividing 3 by 2 results in 1.5, which can't be used in a range.  
   :feedback_c: This would be true if dividing by 2 was truncated to 1.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if 1.5 was rounded to 2, but that doesn't happen.

   What would happen if we changed line 2 to `myList = range(0,len(myString)/2)`? (Hint: You could try it)
