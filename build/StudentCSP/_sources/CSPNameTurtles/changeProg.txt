Changing Turtle Programs
==============================

Run the following program.  

.. activecode:: Turtle_Names4
    :tour_1: "Line-by-line Tour"; 1: first-turtle-line-1; 2: first-turtle-line-2; 3: first-turtle-line-3; 4: first-turtle-line-4; 5: first-turtle-line-5; 6: first-turtle-line-6;
    :nocodelens:
	
    from turtle import * 	# use the turtle library
    space = Screen()    	# create a turtle screen (space)
    alex = Turtle()      	# create a turtle named alex
    alex.forward(150)     	# tell alex to move forward by 150 units
    alex.left(90)       	# turn by 90 degrees
    alex.forward(75)      	# tell alex to move forward by 75 units

.. mchoice:: 5_6_1_Turtle_Names4_Q1
   :answer_a: Change the 150 to 90
   :answer_b: Change the 75 to 90
   :answer_c: Change the 75 to 150
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: The turtle moves forward 150 units and turns 90 degrees.
   :feedback_b: The turtle moves forward 75 units and turns 90 degrees.
   :feedback_c: Then both sides would be 150 units long.

   If you wanted to make both of the turtle lines in that last program the same length, what change would you make to the program?  (Feel free to actually make the change in the program and click *Run* to try it!)


**Slightly Harder Problem:** Now, let's connect the end point to the starting point.  The shape we'll create is a right triangle (a triangle that has a 90 degree interior angle).  The number 57 isn't guesswork -- it is roughly the square root of 40^2 + 40^2.  However, there is an error in this program and it won't work as intended.  **Can you fix it?**  

.. activecode:: Turtle_Names5
    :nocodelens:
	
    from turtle import * 	# use the turtle library
    space = Screen()     	# create a turtle screen (space)
    alex = Turtle()      	# create a turtle named alex
    alex.forward(40)     	# tell alex to move forward by 150 units
    alex.left(90)       	# turn by 90 degrees
    alex.forward(40)     	# complete the second leg of a triangle
    alex.left(0)         	# ZERO won't actually work
    alex.forward(57)      	# Close the triangle


.. mchoice:: 5_6_2_Turtle_Names5_Q1
   :answer_a: alex.left(45)
   :answer_b: alex.left(90)
   :answer_c: alex.left(135)
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: The turtle turns the exterior angle, not the interior angle.
   :feedback_b: That would make another right angle. Which would be more like a square shape.
   :feedback_c: The interior angles of a triangle need to add up to 180.  So far we have one angle of 90 so the other two must be equal and must total 90.  They both have to be 45, but we tell the turtle to turn the exterior angle so 180 - 45 = 135.

   The code ``alex.left(0)`` will not turn the turtle toward the starting point.  Which of these will?
   
.. parsonsprob:: 5_6_3_Turtle-T

   The following program uses a turtle to draw a capital T as shown to the left, <img src="../_static/TurtleT.png" width="150" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5"/> but the lines are mixed up.  The program should do all necessary set-up, create the turtle.  After that the turtle should turn to face north, draw a line that is 150 pixels long, turn to face west, and draw a line that is 50 pixels long.  Next, the turtle should turn 180 degrees and draw a line that is 100 pixels long.  Finally, set the window to close when the user clicks in it.<br /><br /><p>Drag the blocks of statements from the left column to the right column and put them in the right order.  Then click on <i>Check Me</i> to see if you are right. You will be told if any of the lines are in the wrong order.</p>

.. parsonsprob:: 5_6_4_Turtle-A

   The following program uses a turtle to draw a capital A as shown to the left, <img src="../_static/letterA.png" width="150" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5"/> but the lines are mixed up.  The program should do all necessary set-up, create the turtle.  After that the turtle should turn left, draw a line that is 100 pixels long, turn right 135 degrees and draw another line that is 100 pixels long.  Then the turtle should reverse direction and draw a line 50 pixels long and then turn left to draw the line between the other two lines.
