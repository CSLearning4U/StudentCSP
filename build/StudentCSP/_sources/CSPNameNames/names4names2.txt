Naming Everything
========================================

*Learning Objectives:*

- Learn how to define new functions and procedures.
- Learn that we can use libraries containing functions and procedures written by others.
- Learn that *any* name can be renamed, even Python's internal names.

Earlier we learned about how a variable can store a value in a memory location (box).  The "value" can be anything.  It doesn't have to just be a number
or a string.  It can be steps, instructions, and even other names.  This ability to 
name other things is key to `Alan Turing's <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing>`_ vision of a computer.
