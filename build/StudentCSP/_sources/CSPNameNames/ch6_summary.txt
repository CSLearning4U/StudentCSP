Chapter 6 - Summary
============================

Chapter 6 included the following concepts from computing.

..	index::
    single: abstraction
    single: actual parameter
	single: argument
	single: call
	single: define
	single: execute
	single: formal parameter
	single: function
	single: library
	single: parameter
	single: procedure
	single: run
	
- **Abstraction** - Abstraction means focusing on just the important details in a context.  An example is the abstract female figure used to indicate a restroom for females.
- **Actual Parameter** - An actual parameter is a value passed into a procedure or function when it is called.  In ``forward(50)`` the actual parameter is 50.  This is also called an **argument**.  
- **Argument** - An argument is a value passed into a procedure or function when it is called.  In ``forward(50)`` the argument is 50.  This is also called an **actual parameter**.  
- **Call** - You can call or run a procedure or function by using the name of the procedure or function followed by values to pass into the procedure or function.  An example is ``forward(50)``.  This is also known as **executing** or **running** a procedure or function.
- **Define** - You can define a new procedure or function in Python using the ``def`` keyword.
- **Execute** - Execute means to **run** or **call** a procedure or function.  
- **Formal Parameter** - A formal parameter is named input in the definition of a procedure or function.  This is also called a **parameter**.  
- **Function** - A function is a named set of instructions that *returns a result*.  An example is the ``abs(num)`` which returns the absolute value of the num.  
- **Library** - A library is a named group of related procedures and functions.  An example is the Turtle library.
- **Parameter** - A parameter is input to a procedure or function that is named when you define the procedure or function. It will be assigned a value when you call the procedure or function.  This is also called a **formal parameter**.   
- **Procedure** - A procedure is a named set of instructions that *does not return a result*, but can cause something to happen like the turtle ``forward(amount)`` procedure. 
- **Run** - To run a procedure or function use the name of the procedure or function in your program.  This is also known as **calling** or **executing** a procedure or function.
