A **computer** is a device that can perform actions on input (which is also called data).  The actions are specified by a **program**, which is a sequence of instructions.  A computer doesn't really even have to be electronic.  Did you know that there were female computers?  `The Harvard computers <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Computers>`_ were hired to do astronomical calculations.  Computer was a job title, like waiter or doctor.

Computers today are electronic, but it's possible to build a computer with light, or DNA, or even `TinkerToys <http://www.retrothing.com/2006/12/the_tinkertoy_c.html>`_.  All computers manipulate data based on instructions.
