This Book is for Students
==========================

This chapter introduces the approach used in this book and offers some quick "teasers" of things we'll be doing later.  **Don't worry if you don't understand the code (programs - instructions that a computer can understand) that you see in this chapter**.  We'll go through things much more slowly in the next few chapters.  This book is intended for students who haven't programmed before.  If you are a teacher then send email to cslearn4u@gmail.com to get access to the teacher edition of this book which contains several features just for teachers.

This electronic book is different because it uses *examples plus practice*.  Most computer science books are about becoming professional software developers (people who write programs for a living).  Most computer science courses require you to write lots of code.  This book helps students learn how *programming* without making you write lots of code.  It will use the programming language **Python** which is used by companies like Google and Pixar.

- Rather than have you write lots of code, we will ask you to *read* a lot of code *examples*.
- We ask you to *use* what you are learning from the examples in some simple *practice* exercises.  These exercises are meant to be short and easy.
- **You don't have to install anything**.  You will read, edit, and run programs all from within the pages of this ebook inside the browser.
