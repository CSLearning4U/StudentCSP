Compute with Words
===================

..	index::
	single: string
	pair: programming; string

The computer can also compute with words, or more accurately, with **strings** which are sequences of characters.  We can create a **string** by typing characters between a pair of single (``'Hi'``), double (``"Hi"``), or triple quotes ('''Hi'''). We can "compute" with strings using some of the same basic arithmetic operators -- they just mean something different here.  Here we generate silly song lyrics by using ``+`` to combine (append) two strings and ``*`` to repeat strings.

Underneath the program below, to the right of the *Run* button |runbutton|, you'll see the button to open the audio tour for this program: |audiobutton|.  Click on that button and then click on "Line-by-line Tour" to hear the audio tour.  You can use the provided buttons to pause, play, jump ahead, or go back. 

.. activecode:: String_Operators
  :tour_1: "Line-by-line Tour"; 1: str1-line1; 2: str1-line2; 3: str1-line3; 4: str1-line4; 5: str1-line5; 6: str1-line6; 7: str1-line7; 8: str1-line8; 9: str1-line9; 10: str1-line10;
  :nocodelens:
  
  basic = "Ma"
  print(basic)
  basic3 = basic + basic + basic
  print(basic3)
  next = "Mow"
  next3 = next * 3
  print(next3)
  together = (basic * 3) + (next * 2)
  print(together)
  print(together + "Mmm" + together)

	single: dot-notation
	pair: programming; dot-notation

A string can also be asked to return a new string that is changed in some way from the original string.  In the example below, we'll take a string in all-caps and turn it into a nicely capitalized sentence.  This example uses **dot-notation** (``sentence.lower()``) which is the way to tell a string how we want it to change. 

.. activecode:: String_Methods
   :tour_1: "Line-by-line Tour"; 1: str2-line1; 2: str2-line2; 3: str2-line3; 4: str2-line4; 5: str2-line5;
   :nocodelens:
   
   sentence = "THIS IS A TEST"
   better = sentence.lower()
   print(better)
   betterStill = better.capitalize() + "."
   print(betterStill)

   :answer_e: HiThere2
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: When you add strings together you copy the second string right after the first, without any added space
   :feedback_b: Remember that * 2 repeats two copies of the same string
   :feedback_c: Adding strings together and repeating them doesn't add spaces between the strings
   :feedback_d: Strings are added together without adding any space and they are repeated without adding a space
   :feedback_e: The * 2 repeats the string two times
   
   What would the following code print?
   
   :: 
   
      first = "Hi"
      next = "There"
      print ((first + next) * 2)
