Chapter 1 - Concept Summary
============================

Chapter 1 included the following concepts from computing.

..	index::
	single: code
	single: comment
	single: dot-notation
	single: library
	single: pixel
	single: program
	single: screen
	single: variable

- **Code** - Code is a set of instructions that a computer can understand.  This is sometimes called a **program**.  
- **Comment** -  Comments explain what weâ€™re doing in the programs and are intended to be read by people, not computers.  In Python a comment starts with ``#``.  The computer will ignore everything from the start of the comment to the end of that line.
- **Dot-Notation** - Dot-notation is how you ask an object to do something in Python.  You use the name of the object followed by a dot (period) and then followed by what you want it to do and then any values in parentheses.  For example to return a new string will all lowercase letters from a variable called ``sentence`` use ``sentence.lower()``.   To ask a turtle named ``alex`` to go forward 50 units use ``alex.forward(50)``.
- **Library** - A library is a group of **programs** that provides some functionality.  The ``Turtle`` library is a good example.  It lets us create and work with ``Turtle`` objects.  
- **Pixel** - A pixel is one small part (element) of a picture.  Pixels are stored in a grid and have both x (horizontal) and y (vertical) values.  A pixel has a color which can be defined by an amount of red, green, and blue with values from 0 to 255.  
- **Program** - A program is a set of instructions that a computer can understand to accomplish some goal.  This is sometimes called **code**.  
- **Screen** - A ``Screen`` is part of the Turtle library.  It is a space on the page for the turtle to move in and draw on.
- **String** - A string is anything we can type between a pair of pair of single quotes (``'Hi'``), double quotes (``"Hi"``), or triple quotes (``'''Hi'''``).  It is a sequence of characters.  
- **Variable** -  A variable is a name associated with computer memory that can hold a value and that value can change or vary. One example of a variable is the score in a game.
