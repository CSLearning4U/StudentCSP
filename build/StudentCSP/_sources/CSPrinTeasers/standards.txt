Standards - Big Ideas
=====================

This book will address the following Big Ideas from the Computer Science Principles Course:

 - *Big Idea 1: Creativity*:
 - LO 1.2.1: ... Create a computational artifact for creative expression.
 - LO 1.2.2: ... Create a computational artifact using computing tools and techniques to solve a problem.
 - LO 1.2.3: ... Create a new computational artifact by combining or modifying existing artifacts. 
 - LO 1.3.1: ... Use computing tools and techniques for creative expression. 

 - *Big Idea 2: Abstraction*:
 - LO 2.2.1: ... Develop an abstraction when writing a program or creating other computational artifacts.
 - LO 2.2.2: ... Use multiple levels of abstraction to write programs.
 
 - *Big Idea 3: Data and Information*:
 - LO 3.1.1: ... Use computers to process information, find patterns, and test hypotheses about digitally processed information to gain insight and knowledge.
 - LO 3.2.1: ... Extract information from data to discover and explain connections, patterns, or trends. 
 - LO 3.2.2: ... Use large data sets to explore and discover information and knowledge. 
 
 - *Big Idea 4: Algorithms*:
 - LO 4.1.1: ... Develop an algorithm for implementation in a program. 
 - LO 4.1.2: ... Express an algorithm in a language.
 - LO 4.2.3: ... Explain the existence of undecidable problems in computer science.
 - LO 4.2.4: ... Evaluate algorithms analytically and empirically for efficiency, correctness, and clarity.
 
 - *Big Idea 5: Programming*:
 - LO 5.1.1: ... Develop a program for creative expression, to satisfy personal curiosity, or to create new knowledge. 
 - LO 5.1.2: ... Develop a correct program to solve problems. 
 - LO 5.2.1: ... Explain how programs implement algorithms.
 - LO 5.3.1: ... Use abstraction to manage complexity in programs.
 - LO 5.4.1: ... Evaluate the correctness of a program.
 - LO 5.5.1: ... Employ appropriate mathematical and logical concepts in programming.
 
This chapter should have given you a sense for what we are going to be doing with a computer in this book.  Let's get started in the next chapter by talking about what the computer can do and how you can control it.
