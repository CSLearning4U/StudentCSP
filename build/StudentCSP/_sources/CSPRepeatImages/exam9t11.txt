       :answer_a: !We're off to see the Wizard!
       :answer_b: !draziW eht ees ot ffo er'eW!
       :answer_c: We're off to see the Wizard!!draziW eht ees ot ffo er'eW
       :answer_d: !draziW eht ees ot ffo er'eW!We're off to see the Wizard!
       :correct: d
       :feedback_a: This would be true if it was newString = newString + letter
       :feedback_b: This would be true if it was newString = letter + newString
       :feedback_c: This would be true if it was newString = letter + newString in the loop and you printed phrase + newString
       :feedback_d: This code adds each letter to the front and back of the string which will print the reverse of the string ! and the string.

       Given the following code, what will be printed? 
       
       ::

          newString = "!"
          phrase = "We're off to see the Wizard!"
          for letter in phrase:
              newString = letter + newString + letter
          print (newString)

       :answer_a: X = 5 and Y = 72
       :answer_b: X = 36 and Y = 10
       :answer_c: X = 10 and Y = 36
       :answer_d: X = 12 and Y = 30
       :correct: c
       :feedback_a: This would be true if you were trying to draw a 5 sided figure.
       :feedback_b: This would be true if you were trying to draw a 36 sided figure.
       :feedback_c: The value of X is 10 to make a 10 sided figure and the amount to turn is 360 / 10 = 36.
       :feedback_d: This would be true if you were trying to draw a 12 sided figure.

       If we would like to draw a decagon (10 sided figure), what should the values of X and Y be in the code below?
       
       ::
       
          from turtle import *       # use the turtle library
          space = Screen()           # create a turtle space
          zoe = Turtle()             # create a turtle named zoe
          zoe.setheading(90)         # point due north
          for sides in range(X):     # repeat the indented lines X times
              zoe.forward(50)        # move forward by 50 units
              zoe.right(Y)           # And turn each one by Y

       :answer_a: Pictures are made up of little pixels, laid out on an (x,y) grid.
       :answer_b: Each pixel is stored as a number between 0 and 255.
       :answer_c: Each color has a red part, a green part, and a blue part.
       :answer_d: Each color part is actually a number between 0 and 255.
       :correct: b
       :feedback_a: Pictures are grids of pixels.
       :feedback_b: A pixel has a color and the color has a red, green, and blue part.
       :feedback_c: One way to describe a color is a combination of red, green, and blue.
       :feedback_d: On a computer the value for red, green, and blue is between 0 and 255.

       Which of the following statements is false?
       
    .. mchoice:: e9t11_4
       :answer_a: Double the blue and green values in the picture
       :answer_b: Halve the blue and green values in the picture
       :answer_c: Set the green values to half the original blue and the blue to half the original green
       :answer_d: Set the green to double half the original blue and the blue to double the original green
       :correct: c
       :feedback_a: This would be true if it was p.setGreen(g * 2) and p.setBlue(b * 2)
       :feedback_b: This would be true if it was p.setGreen(g / 2) and p.setBlue(b / 2)
       :feedback_c: This sets the green values to half the original blue values and the blue values to half the original green values.
       :feedback_d: This would be true if it was p.setGreen(b * 2) and p.setBlue(g * 2)

       What does the following code do?
       
       ::
       
          from image import *
          img = Image("beach.jpg")
          pixels = img.getPixels()
          for p in pixels:
              g = p.getGreen()
              b = p.getBlue()
              p.setGreen(b / 2)
              p.setBlue(g / 2)
              img.updatePixel(p)
          win = ImageWin(img.getWidth(), img.getHeight())
          img.draw(win)

       :correct: a
       :feedback_a: This stamps 5 turtles on a circle with a radius of 25.
       :feedback_b: This would be true if the line zoe.penup() was removed.
       :feedback_c: This would be true if it was range(10) and right(36)
       :feedback_d: This would be true if it was range(10) and right(36) and if the line zoe.penup() was removed.

       What would the following draw?
       
       ::
       
          from turtle import *       
          space = Screen()           
          zoe = Turtle()            
          zoe.shape("turtle")       
          zoe.penup()
          for size in range(5):     
              zoe.forward(50)      
              zoe.stamp()  
              zoe.forward(-50)
              zoe.right(72)
